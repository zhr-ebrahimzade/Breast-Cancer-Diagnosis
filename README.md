#  Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using CESM Images

This project applies deep learning to breast cancer diagnosis using Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) images. It uses the DenseNet121 model to classify images as benign, malignant, or normal. Developed as part of a Data Mining course, it aims to improve accuracy in medical image analysis.
## Features

- **CESM Image Preprocessing**: Resize images and handle memory efficiently.
- **Deep Learning Classification**: Utilizes DenseNet121 architecture for image classification.
- **Dataset Splitting**: Custom random selection for training, validation, and testing sets.


## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/zhr-ebrahimzade/Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
## Roadmap

- Add more advanced image preprocessing.

- Experiment with additional deep learning architectures such as ResNet.
